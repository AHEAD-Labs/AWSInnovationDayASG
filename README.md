# AHEAD Innovation Days

This repo contains all the information needed to support the AHEAD Innovation Days event focused on Automation, Security, and Governance. The workshop contains six (6) labs for attendees to work through with the intended purpose to learning how to operationalize and manage an AWS environment after the initial deployment. As a follow up to our *Getting Started with AWS* workshop, participants will gain hands-on experience with AWS services such as AWS CloudFormation, AWS Config, Amazon SNS, AWS Auto Scaling, and AWS Config.

## Getting Started

Each folder in the repo represents a lab within the workshop. The folder contains the CloudFormation templates and other files pertinent the labs. Included in each folder is the lab guide so participants can easily run through the lab again or simply use it to copy/paste URLs or other information throughout the lab guide.
